# Backend - GFG Student Chapter

This directory will contain the backend logic, Edge Functions, and Database migrations.

## Tech Stack (Planned)
- Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage)
- Supabase Edge Functions (TypeScript)
- Row Level Security (RLS) Policies

## Setup
Currently, the frontend connects directly to Supabase via the client in `frontend/lib/supabase.ts`. 
Future server-side logic should be placed here.
